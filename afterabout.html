   <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">There are many health benefits of owning a pet. They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. 
    Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels.  Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. 
    Most households in the United States have at least one pet.
    Before adopting a new pet, make sure that it is the right one for you and your family. Do some research beforehand about the specific needs of the animal.
    Children 5 years of age and younger, people with weakened immune systems, and people 65 years of age and older are more likely to get diseases spread between animals and people (also known as zoonotic diseases).
     Pregnant women are also at a higher risk for certain animal-related diseases.

    
    Online pet adoption sites have databases of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups, and are searchable by the public.
    
    
    A black cat waiting to be adopted. Because of the superstitions surrounding black cats, they are disproportionately more common in shelters than in the general population and less likely to be adopted than are cats of other colors.
    People deal with their unwanted pets in many ways. Some people have the pet euthanized (also known as putting down or putting to sleep), although many veterinarians do not consider this to be an ethical use of their resources for young and healthy animals, 
    while others argue that euthanasia is a more humane option than leaving a pet in a cage for very long periods of time. Other people simply release the pet into the wild or otherwise abandon it, with the expectation that it will be able to take care of itself or 
    that it will be found and adopted. More often, these pets succumb to hunger, weather, traffic, or common and treatable health problems. Some people euthanize pets because of terminal illnesses or injuries, while others even do it for common health problems that
     they cannot, or will not, pay to treat. More responsible owners will take the pet to a shelter, or call a rescue organization, where it will be cared for properly until a home can be found. Another method is rehoming (finding another owner). Reasons for surrendering
      a pet may be due to allergies, the pet-owner's death, divorce, the birth of a baby, or relocation.
